# Automatic-Plant-Watering-System

Working with Alex Bailey, we designed an automatic plant watering system that is adjustable to anyone's needs. The system is easy to work with, cheap, accessible, and has plenty of room for expansion. All controls are done my a Raspberry Pi Pico and a special sensor that can detect moisture levels of most
mediums.
